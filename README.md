# Hangman Game in Python

## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.


This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The aim of the project is to provide a fun and interactive way to guess words and improve Python programming skills. The project covers various aspects of Python, including random selection, string manipulation, and user input handling.

## Usage

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Hangman game script.


Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Guess letters to uncover the hidden word and try to guess the word within the given number of lives.

## How to Play
- The game starts with a random word from a predefined list.
- You have a limited number of lives to guess the word.
- Enter a single letter as your guess. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, you lose a life.
- Continue guessing until you guess the entire word or run out of lives.
